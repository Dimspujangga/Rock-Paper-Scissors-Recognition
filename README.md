This project is a simple machine learning model designed to recognize Rock, Paper, and Scissors hand gestures through static images. The model will detect the hand shape given in the photo and classify it as one of the three choices in the Rock Paper Scissors game.

Features :
1. Static Image Classification: The model recognizes hand gestures from photos, with three main categories: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
2. Machine Learning Pipeline: The project includes a simple pipeline for training the model and testing the classification results.
3. Deep Learning Model: Built using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify images with high accuracy.
